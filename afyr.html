			<h4>What are we talking about ?</h4>
			<p>It is about automating all the tasks that you may have to do everyday or every week. Those that are repetitive and with no value added, so that anyone could do them. These kind of tasks are ideal for robots. Robots do not lose concentration. Robots do not get tired. Robots do not get delayed. Robots work faster. Therefore, the longer these tasks are, the more you need a robotic companion to help you maximising your time.</p>
			<h4>How are these robots done ?</h4>
			<p>Robots can be written in almost any programming language but I work mostly in Python because its libraries give an incredibly wide range of possibilities. Moreover, as I have been working as an RPA developer I can also build these bots with UiPath.</p>

				<h4>Python</h4>
				<img src="images/python.png">
				<p>Python is an open source programming language that has a huge amount of libraries that will give us enough flexibility to make almost any robot you can imagine. What's more, it can be easily distributed as an .exe and can be mount in production very quickly. As a drawback, it is slower than other programming languages. Still, it is in my opinion the best choice.</p>

				<h4>RPA</h4>
				<img src="images/rpa.png">
				<p>RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation and it is a new field that has seen the surge of lots of companies racing to become unicorns in just a few years. UiPath is the leader of that market at the time of writing these lines, followed by Blueprim and Automation Anywhere. The most valuable benefit of making robots with UiPath is that workflows can be easily modified without any knowledge of coding, so once the robot is built, you can edit it at wish. The drawback is that in order to use UiPath's platform you need a license which can be expensive for small companies.</p>
